# -Python-Conditional-Statements-and-Loops-Practice-
#This project is a Python script that demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, and logical operators in Python programming. It includes several examples and exercises to showcase key programming concepts such as equality testing, handling multiple conditions, simple if statements, if-else logic, and the usage of for loops for iterating over lists.

The project covers:

Conditional Testing:

Examples of equality tests, such as checking specific string matches (case-sensitive).
Logical operations, including comparisons using and, or, and not.
List Iteration with Loops:

Iterating over a list of cars and applying logic to print values differently based on conditions.
Printing each element with unique formatting (e.g., lowercase for 'BMW', title case for others).
Numerical Comparisons:

Checking for specific numbers in a list using loops and conditional statements.
Using comparison operators (==, >, >=, etc.) to determine equality or inequality.
If-Else Statements:

Demonstrating how to use if and if-else statements to make decisions based on conditions.
Examples include voting eligibility checks based on age.
Logical Operators in Multiple Conditions:

Using and to verify multiple conditions simultaneously, such as comparing two age variables.
Purpose of the Project
This project is designed for beginners and intermediate programmers who want to:

Strengthen their understanding of Python control flow (if, if-else, and loops).
Practice working with lists, loops, and conditional logic.
Learn how to handle simple decision-making scenarios in Python.
Understand the basics of writing clean, readable, and logically sound code.
